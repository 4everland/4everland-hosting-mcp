A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation
for [4EVERLAND Hosting](https://docs.4everland.org/hositng/what-is-hosting) enabling instant deployment of AI-generated
code to decentralized storage networks like Greenfield, IPFS, and Arweave.

## Overview

The 4EVERLAND Hosting MCP Server enables users to leverage AI-driven workflows to deploy code instantly to decentralized
storage networks such as Greenfield, IPFS, and Arweave. Upon deployment, it provides a directly accessible webpage
domain, streamlining the process of deploying and sharing decentralized applications.

## Features

- **Instant Deployment with Domain Generation**: Deploy AI-generated code to decentralized storage networks and receive
  a unique, immediately accessible webpage domain with a single command.
- **Multiple Decentralized Storage Networks**: Support for Greenfield, IPFS, and Arweave, enabling flexible and
  resilient storage options for your applications.
- **Secure and Loss-Proof Decentralized Storage**: Leverage the robust, tamper-resistant, and highly available nature of
  decentralized storage to ensure data security and prevent data loss.
- **Visual Project Management Interface**: Manage your deployed projects, view detailed information, or configure custom
  domains directly in the [4EVERLAND Dashboard](https://dashboard.4everland.org/).
